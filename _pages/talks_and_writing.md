I spoke at the [Gender and Intersectionality in Post Soviet Armenia Conference](https://www.international.ucla.edu/armenia/event/15197) hosted by the [Promise Armenian Institute at UCLA](https://www.international.ucla.edu/armenia/welcome) and the [Zorian Institute](https://zoryaninstitute.org/).

I often indulge in feminist topics and write about whatever seems to be pressing. Here are my [first](https://www.azadarchives.com/society/bride-kidnapping-crime-culture-everything-in-between/), [second](https://www.azadarchives.com/society/behind-bride-kidnapping-interview-with-chris-edling/), and [third](https://www.azadarchives.com/society/behind-bride-kidnapping-interview-with-lara-aharonian/) articles on bride kidnapping and its cultural origins in Armenia and broader Asia.
